## Tasks

- [] tree merging algorithms

- [] Do the task only if swarm size > 1/2 known total uav number, this number needs to be saved
- [] Record status of each received task

- [] add another "better" tree-merging algorithm
- [] possibly: no node-detaching (stable tree); fly toward the max known swarm; switch parent<->child

- [] split background into different parts and set up writing plan
- [] problem definition
- [] previous example PGT thesis
- [] abstract with keywords
