\begin{abstract}
In recent years, the application of unmanned aerial vehicle swarms
in civilian and military scenarios has become increasingly promising.
There has been a surge of research interest in swarm algorithms.
This thesis proposes a hierarchical swarm algorithm,
where the unmanned aerial vehicles dynamically organise themselves into a tree structure,
and coordinate with each other to carry out assigned tasks.
The algorithm enables large swarms to deal with complex tasks robustly.
The main contributions of this thesis are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item An application scenario of autonomous swarms is conceived (see chapter \ref{chap_problem}).
      The scenario is inspired by drone shows. The task of a swarm is to form designated shapes.
\item Based on the scenario,
      a new algorithm is designed for the hierarchical control and coordination of swarms
      (see chapter \ref{chap_design}).
\item The algorithm is implemented in the Rust programming language
      with more than 2000 lines of source code (see chapter \ref{chap_impl}).
\item Simulations are carried out
      to demonstrate the design and implementation of the algorithm (see chapter \ref{chap_sim}).
      The results show that
      the algorithm is suitable for large swarm size and complex task coordination.
\end{itemize}

Keywords: UAV swarm, hierarchical swarm, swarm control, swarm coordination.
