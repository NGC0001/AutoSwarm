   abstract = {Drones are also known as UAVs are originally designed for military purposes. With the technological advances, they can be seen in most of the aspects of life from filming to logistics. The increased use of drones made it sometimes essential to form a collaboration between them to perform the task efficiently in a defined process. This paper investigates the use of a combined centralised and decentralised architecture for the collaborative operation of drones in a parts delivery scenario to enable and expedite the operation of the factories of the future. The centralised and decentralised approaches were extensively researched, with experimentation being undertaken to determine the appropriateness of each approach for this use-case. Decentralised control was utilised to remove the need for excessive communication during the operation of the drones, resulting in smoother operations. Initial results suggested that the decentralised approach is more appropriate for this use-case. The individual functionalities necessary for the implementation of a decentralised architecture were proven and assessed, determining that a combination of multiple individual functionalities, namely VSLAM, dynamic collision avoidance and object tracking, would give an appropriate solution for use in an industrial setting. A final architecture for the parts delivery system was proposed for future work, using a combined centralised and decentralised approach to combat the limitations inherent in each architecture.},

As the core part of mission planning, task assignment is an important guarantee for UAV swarms to complete military missions and through the entire process of UAV operations. Firstly, the typical task assignment model of UAV and its improvement are described. Secondly, the centralized, distributed, and central-distributed solving methods of the model are systematically sorted out, and the applications of typical algorithms are summarized and analyzed. Finally, based on the existing research, the development directions of UAV swarm task assignment field are discussed from four aspects of the establishment of realistic models, task assignment under uncertain conditions, dynamic real-time task assignment, and task assignment based on artificial intelligence methods.},

   abstract = {Simulation platforms are critical and indispensable tools for application developments of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) because the UAVs are generally costly, have certain requirements for the test environment, and need professional licensed operators. Thus, developers prefer (or have) to test their applications on simulation platforms before implementing them on real machines. In the past decades, a considerable number of simulation platforms for robots have been developed, which brings convenience to developers, but also makes them hard to choose a proper one as they are not always familiar with all the features of platforms. To alleviate this dilemma, this paper provides a survey of open-source simulation platforms and employs the simulation of a multi-copter UAV swarm as an example. The survey covers seven widely used simulators, including Webots, Gazebo, CoppeliaSim, ARGoS, MRDS, MORSE, and USARSim. The paper outlines the requirements for multi-copter UAV swarms and shows how to select an appropriate platform. Additionally, the paper presents a case study of a UAV swarm based on Webots. This research will be beneficial to researchers, developers, educators, and engineers who seek suitable simulation platforms for application development, (not only multi-copter UAV swarms but also other types of robots), which further helps them to save expenses for testing, and speed up development progress.},

   abstract = {UAVs have rapidly become prevalent in applications related to surveillance, military operations, and disaster relief. Their low cost, operational flexibility, and unmanned capabilities make them ideal for accomplishing tasks in areas deemed dangerous for humans to enter. They can also accomplish previous high-cost and labor-intensive tasks, such as land surveying, in a faster and cheaper manner. Researchers studying UAV applications have realized that a swarm of UAVs working collaboratively on tasks can achieve better results. The dynamic work environment of UAVs makes controlling the vehicles a challenge. This is magnified by using multiple agents in a swarm. Resiliency is a broad concept that effectively defines how well a system handles disruptions in its normal functioning. The task of building resilient swarms has been attempted by researchers for the past decade. However, research on current trends shows gaps in swarm designs that make evaluating the resiliency of such swarms less than ideal. The authors believe that a complete well-defined system built from the ground up is the solution. This survey evaluates existing literature on resilient multi-UAV systems and lays down the groundwork for how best to develop a truly resilient system.},

   abstract = {With the continuous development of artificial intelligence, swarm control and other technologies, the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the battlefield is more and more extensive, and the UAV swarm is increasingly playing a prominent role in the future of warfare. How tasks are assigned in the dynamic and complex battlefield environment is very important. This paper proposes a task assignment model and its objective function based on dynamic information convergence. In order to resolve this multidimensional function, the Wolf Pack Algorithm (WPA) is selected as the alternative optimization algorithm. This is because its functional optimization of high-dimensional complex problems is better than other intelligent algorithms, and the fact that it is more suitable for UAV swarm task allocation scenarios. Based on the traditional WPA algorithm, this paper proposes a Multi-discrete Wolf Pack Algorithm (MDWPA) to solve the UAV task assignment problem in a complex environment through the discretization of wandering, calling, sieging behavior, and new individual supplement. Through Orthogonal Experiment Design (OED) and analysis of variance, the results show that MDWPA performs with better accuracy, robustness, and convergence rate and can effectively solve the task assignment problem of UAVs in a complex dynamic environment.},

   abstract = {The strength of gnomes lies in their coordinated action. Being small and subtle creatures themselves, the forest gnomes can form large swarms acting as one giant creature. This unusual defense strategy requires a lot of skill and training. Directing a swarm is not an easy task! Initially, gnomes used leader-based control algorithms, although those have been proven to be vulnerable to abuse and failure. After thorough research and study, gnomes developed their own leaderless consensus algorithm based on very simple rules. It is based on gossip in a network of a known diameter $d$. One of the gnomes proposes a plan which then spreads gnome to gnome. If there is an agreement, gnomes act \emph\{all at once\}. If there are conflicting plans (an extreme rarity), they try again. The resulting upper bound on the swarm's reaction time is its round-trip time $2dt$, where $t$ is the command relay time. The original algorithm is non-Byzantine; all gnomes must be sane and sober. While working on the algorithm, gnomes discovered \emph\{swarm time\}, a sibling concept to L.Lamport's logical time. That led to a Byzantine-ready version of the algorithm.},

In addition, the expansion of this market has been accompanied by the birth and growth of the so-called UAV swarms. Currently, the expansion of these systems is due to their properties in terms of robustness, versatility, and efficiency. Along with these properties there is an aspect, which is still a field of study, such as autonomous and cooperative navigation of these swarms. In this paper we present an architecture that includes a set of complementary methods that allow the establishment of different control layers to enable the autonomous and cooperative navigation of a swarm of UAVs. Among the different layers, there are a global trajectory planner based on sampling, algorithms for obstacle detection and avoidance, and methods for autonomous decision making based on deep reinforcement learning. The paper shows satisfactory results for a line-of-sight based algorithm for global path planner trajectory smoothing in 2D and 3D. In addition, a novel method for autonomous navigation of UAVs based on deep reinforcement learning is shown, which has been tested in 2 different simulation environments with promising results about the use of these techniques to achieve autonomous navigation of UAVs.},

The communication architecture defines how information is exchanged between UAVs or between UAVs and the central control center. Routing protocols help provide reliable end-to-end data transmission. Therefore, it is particularly important to design UAV swarm communication architectures and routing protocols with high performance and stability. This review article details four communication architectures including the advantages and disadvantages. Applicable scenarios are also discussed. In addition, a systematic overview and feasibility research of routing protocols are presented in this paper. To spur further research, the open research issues of UAV swarm communication architectures and routing protocols are also investigated.},

   abstract = {To perform air missions with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is a significant trend in warfare. The task assignment among the UAV swarm is one of the key issues in such missions. This paper proposes PSO-GA-DWPA (discrete wolf pack algorithm with the principles of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm) to solve the task assignment of a UAV swarm with fast convergence speed. The PSO-GA-DWPA is confirmed with three different ground-attack scenarios by experiments. The comparative results show that the improved algorithm not only converges faster than the original WPA and PSO, but it also exhibits excellent search quality in high-dimensional space.},

   abstract = {Swarm robotic search is concerned with searching targets in unknown environments (e.g., for search and rescue or hazard localization), using a large number of collaborating simple mobile robots. In such applications, decentralized swarm systems are touted for their task/coverage scalability, time efficiency, and fault tolerance. To guide the behavior of such swarm systems, two broad classes of approaches are available, namely nature-inspired swarm heuristics and multi-robotic search methods. However, simultaneously offering computationally-efficient scalability and fundamental insights into the exhibited behavior (instead of a black-box behavior model), remains challenging under either of these two class of approaches. In this paper, we develop an important extension of the batch Bayesian search method for application to embodied swarm systems, searching in a physical 2D space. Key contributions lie in: 1) designing an acquisition function that not only balances exploration and exploitation across the swarm, but also allows modeling knowledge extraction over trajectories; and 2) developing its distributed implementation to allow asynchronous task inference and path planning by the swarm robots. The resulting collective informative path planning approach is tested on target search case studies of varying complexity, where the target produces a spatially varying (measurable) signal. Significantly superior performance, in terms of mission completion efficiency, is observed compared to exhaustive search and random walk baselines, along with favorable performance scalability with increasing swarm size.},

   abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have significantly disrupted the aviation industry. As technology and policy continue to develop, this disruption is only going to increase in magnitude. A specific technology poised to escalate this disruption is UAV swarm. UAV swarm has the potential to distribute tasks and coordinate operation of many UAVs with little to no operator intervention. This paper surveys literature regarding UAV swarm and proposes a swarm architecture that will allow for higher levels of swarm autonomy and reliability by utilizing cellular mobile wireless communication infrastructure. This paper chronicles initial testbed development to meet this proposed architecture. Focused development of UAV swarms with UAV-to-UAV communication autonomous coordination ability is central to advancing the utility of UAV swarms. The use of cellular mobile framework alleviates many limiting factors that hinder the utility of UAVs including range of communication, networking challenges, and size-weight-and-power considerations. In addition, cellular networks leverage a robust and reliable infrastructure for machine to machine communication proposed by 5G systems.},

In the proposed scenario, a team of UAVs is required to maximize the reward by collecting colored objects and delivering them to a predefined location. This task consists of several subtasks such as cooperative coverage path planning, object detection and state estimation, UAV self‐localization, precise motion control, trajectory tracking, aerial grasping and dropping, and decentralized team coordination. The failure recovery and synchronization job manager is used to integrate all the presented subtasks together and also to decrease the vulnerability to individual subtask failures in real‐world conditions. The whole system was developed for the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2017, where it achieved the highest score and won Challenge No. 3—Treasure Hunt. This paper does not only contain results from the MBZIRC 2017 competition but it also evaluates the system performance in simulations and field tests that were conducted throughout the year‐long development and preparations for the competition.},

@article{Arrichiello2010,
   abstract = {In this paper we present the application of the Null-Space-based Behavioral (NSB) approach to the motion control of mobile robots with velocity saturated actuators. The NSB is a behavior-based robot control approach that uses a hierarchical organization of the tasks to guarantee that they are executed according to a desired priority: it uses a projection technique to avoid that, in the absence of actuator saturations, low-priority tasks could influence higher-priority tasks. The main contribution of this paper is the extension of the NSB approach to the case where actuator velocity saturation bounds are explicitly taken into account. The proposed solution dynamically scales task velocity commands so that the hierarchy of task priorities is preserved in spite of actuator velocity saturations. The approach has been validated on two specific case studies. In the first case, the NSB elaborates the motion directives for a single mobile robot that has to reach a target while avoiding a point obstacle1 in this case, the mission is composed of two tasks. In the second case, the NSB elaborates the motion directives for a team of six mobile robots that has orates the motion directives for a team of six mobile robots that has to entrap and escort a target1 in this case the mission is composed of four tasks. The approach is validated by numerical simulations and by experiments with real mobile robots.},

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},
