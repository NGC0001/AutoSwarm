loop
  LoopBody -> FlightKinetics : read current velocity
  LoopBody -> GPS : read current position
  LoopBody -> Communication : get received messages

  LoopBody -> Control : (sequence of Control module)\nupdate UAV according to \ncurrent position, current velocity and received messages
  return new velocity and generated messages

  LoopBody -> FlightKinetics : set new velocity
  LoopBody -> Communication : send generated messages
end
