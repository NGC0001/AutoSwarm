NodeManagement -> NodeManagement : remove connections with nodes that go out of communication range
NodeManagement -> NodeManagement : process each received message; \nmodify connections and node states accordingly; \ngenerate necessary response messages
NodeManagement -> NodeManagement : remove connections with silent nodes \nfrom which this UAV has \nnot received messages for too long
alt InTask
  alt a task has been received and task division is done
    NodeManagement -> TaskManagement : execute sub-task
    NodeManagement -> TaskManagement : calculate task velocity
  end
  NodeManagement -> NodeManagement : handle node state transitions, task division, task allocation \naccording to the swarm algorithm
else Free
  NodeManagement -> NodeManagement : switch swarm if there's bigger swarm nearby
end
NodeManagement -> NodeManagement : generate connection messages for parent and children
NodeManagement -> NodeManagement : calculate connection velocity and coordinated velocity
